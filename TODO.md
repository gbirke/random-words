# Next steps

- [ ] Read text from file
- [ ] Refactor to domain classes: Chunk (for encapsulating firstchar, lastchar,
	etc), Corpus and WordGenerator
- [ ] Avoid "dead end" chunks
- [ ] Create CLI
- [ ] Use stop words when processing text
- [ ] generate words in parallel, using goroutines
- [ ] Corpus statistics to get a feeling how different each word will be
- [ ] Experiment with different chunk sizes (2, 4, etc.) Maybe different
	languages need different sizes?

# Done

- [x] Weighted chunk selection
