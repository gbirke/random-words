# Next steps

- [ ] Avoid "dead end" chunks
- [ ] Regenerate duplicate words
- [ ] Create CLI with options
- [ ] Use stop words when processing text
- [ ] generate words in parallel, using goroutines
- [ ] Corpus statistics to get a feeling how different each word will be
- [ ] Experiment with different chunk sizes (2, 4, etc.) Maybe different
	languages need different sizes?
