# Random pronounceable words

This code takes an input text and applies an algorithm for generating
random, meaningless words from it.

The best source for text are word lists of a language. This will avoid
skewing the algorithm towards frequently-used words. Example word list:

Running with a file, generating 200 words with length of 8 characters:

DO NOT USE THESE WORDS AS PASSWORDS!
